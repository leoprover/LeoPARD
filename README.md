=======
*Leo-III's Parallel ARchitecture and Datastructures*

This project contains the data structure framework LeoPARD underlying the Leo-III prover.

In the Leo-III project, we
design and implement a state-of-the-art Higher-Order
Logic Theorem Prover, the successor of the well known
LEO-II prover [[2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-71070-7_14)]. Leo-III will be based on ordered
paramodulation/superposition.
In constrast to LEO-II, we replace the internal term representation
(the commonly used simply typed lambda-calculus)
by a more expressive system supporting type polymorphism.
In order to achieve a substantial performance speed-up,
the architecture of Leo-III will be based on massive parallelism
(e.g. And/Or-Parallelism, Multisearch) [[3](http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1018932114059)]. The
current design is a multi-agent blackboard architecture
that will allow to independently run agents with our proof
calculus as well as agents for external (specialized) provers.
Leo-III will focus right from the start on compatibility to
the widely used TPTP infrastructure [[8](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10817-009-9143-8)]. Moreover, it
will offer built-in support for specialized external prover
agents and provide external interfaces to interactive provers
such as Isabelle/HOL [[5](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-45949-9)]. The implementation will excessively
use term sharing [[6](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1218621), [7](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1218620)] and several indexing techniques
[[4](dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-45744-5_19), [9](dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-71070-7_14)]. Leo-III will also offer special support for
reasoning in various quantified non-classical logics by exploiting
a semantic embedding [[1](dx.doi.org/10.5220/0004324803460351)] approach.

As a test, a small executable can be created than runs a basic propositional reasoning process.

Required Dependencies
----------------

Leo III needs Java 1.7 to run.
Scala 2.11.X is required to build and run the project. Maven will automatically download scala and further dependencies.
Alternatively, Scala can be downloaded at [Scala-lang.org](http://scala-lang.org/download/).


Building the project
----------------

[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) manages the build process of Leo-III. Information about downloading and installing Maven can be found at [the download section of the maven website](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

The project is compiled and built into an executable `.jar` file usng

    > mvn compile assembly::single

Or, alternatively, the makefile can be used. Invoking

    > make

will result in the same `.jar`
    
All test suits are ran by
    
    > mvn test
    
The compiled test class files will be placed at `./target/test-classes/`.

The sole compilation process can be started by typing

    > mvn compile

The compiled files (class files) will be placed at `./target/classes/`.
